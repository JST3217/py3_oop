# Power production from a solar panel is calculated based on
# (1) the panelâ€™s rated power,
# (2) the solar energy availability (monthly average), and
# (3) efficiency loss due to elevated operating temperatures.

# Power production decreases by 5% for every 10degC increase over the design temperature (25degC).
